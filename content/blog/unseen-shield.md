In January of 2021, the [Shabak][Shabak] (the Israel Security Agency) published a set
of CTF challenges at [shabakchallenge.com](https://shabakchallenge.com/).
The original website may be gone now, but I downloaded what I could and uploaded it to
[GitHub][Archive].

For your amusement, I also present writeups on some of the challenges I solved.
They will be linked here as soon as they are published.
