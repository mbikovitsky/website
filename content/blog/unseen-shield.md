summary: Writeups on the Shabak 2021 CTF
---

**Update 2021-02-06**: All challenge writeups posted.

**Update 2021-01-31**: Archive moved to the [Internet Archive][Archive].

In January of 2021, the [Shabak][Shabak] (the Israeli Security Agency) published a set
of CTF challenges at [shabakchallenge.com](https://shabakchallenge.com/).
The original website may be gone now, but I downloaded what I could and uploaded it to
the [Internet Archive][Archive].

For your amusement, I also present writeups on some of the challenges I solved.
~~They will be linked here as soon as they are published.~~
